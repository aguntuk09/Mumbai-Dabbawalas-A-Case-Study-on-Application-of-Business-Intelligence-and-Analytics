### Overview of the organization

The Mumbai Tiffin Box Supplier's Association, commonly known as the Mumbai Dabbawalas, is a well-known organization which supplies lunch boxes to office and college going people. Founded in the year 1890 with a mere 100 dabbawalas, the organization has grown to a size of 5000 dabbawalas has continued to provide delivery services to almost 200,000 Mumbaikars. The end to end delivery process of dabba delivery has three teams. First team has around 20-25 dabbawalas who pick up dabba from the resident address. Second team segregates the dabbas as per the destination and the third team delivers the dabbas to the destination address. The same process is followed in a reverse fashion to deliver the empty dabba to the original pick-up address. The dabbas are coded using a special nomenclature, known by all the dabbawalas in the organization, which makes it easier for delivering the lunch boxes with precision. Realizing the need of the hour and current competition in the food delivery industry, the dabbawalas have adopted technology to maintain their position in the food delivery industry. This project involves the end to end creation of a BI and Analytics system for the Mumbai dabbawalas which includes a database, its various components (tables, data, triggers, etc.) and visulaizations using the data in Power BI.
